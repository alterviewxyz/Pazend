### Jein
Jein is a mix of the words “Ja” for yes and “Nein” for no. Germans will often use this word to describe when when something isn’t clear cut, or they haven’t yet made a decision.

Let’s say you’re talking to a friend about their relationship status. They’ve been dating someone for a while and you want to know if they’re serious yet. You might ask, “Seid ihr jetzt in einer Beziehung?” Are you in a relationship now?, to which they could say, “Jein” (Yes and no. Maybe. Who knows!?).
