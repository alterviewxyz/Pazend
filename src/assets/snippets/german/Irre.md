### Irre
Irre is used the same way in German as crazy! is used in English. It has both good, and bad, connotations depending on how you use it. But mostly it’s used to express bad situations, like:

- “Der Typ is Irre!” – That guy is a lunatic!
- “Ich fand es Irre, wie schlecht ihren Kundendienst war” – I found it crazy how bad their customer service was
- “Es war total Irre, was sie gemacht hat” – It was crazy what she did
