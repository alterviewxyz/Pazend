### Moin

Moin is the shortening of the phrase, “Guten Morgen” or good morning in parts of northern Germany. But lots of people have adopted this as a way of saying “Hello!” in German slang, regardless of what time it is.

I find this term really helpful if you’re saying hello to a group of people – like if you’ve just walked into a party – and you’re not quite sure what to say.
