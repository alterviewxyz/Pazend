### Krass
When the German language isn’t using five words to describe one thing, it’s using one word to try and describe everything. Krass is one of those words, because it can be used to portray both good and bad emotion in equal measure.

It’s often heard as a reply to something. For example, “Robert hat 500 Euro mit einem Rubbellos gewonnen” (Robert won 500 Euros on a scratchcard) could be met with, “Krass!” (Cool!).

But it could also be used as a response to something negative, such as, “Robert hat 500 Euro aus meiner Brieftasche geklaut” (Robert stole 500 euros from my wallet), “Krass! Der typ is Irre!”, (What!? That guy is a lunatic)

You can also use it to describe something; “Das Essen hier is krass! Ich liebe es”, (The food here is great! I love it), or “Das Restaurant is krass, ich finde es immer so dreckig”, (That restaurant is awful, it’s always so dirty).

The words around Krass will help to give it context about whether it’s good or bad.
