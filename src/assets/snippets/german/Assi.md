### Assi

Assi is short for asozial which means chav in British English. You can probably closely relate this to redneck or trailer trash in American English, although it doesn’t quite conjure the same image.

An Assi is someone who is uneducated, unemployed, from a low-income area, who wears fake designer clothes and spends their evenings drinking or doing drugs. This isn’t my opinion, however that’s what people are referring to when they say it.

Assi can also be used to describe something of poor quality or is undesirable. For example, “Ich wollte neue Jeans kaufen, aber alles was ich gesehen hab, war ein bisschen Assi”, (I wanted to buy new jeans, but everything I’ve seen was a little chavvy).
