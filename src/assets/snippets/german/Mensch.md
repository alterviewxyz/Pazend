### Mensch!
Mensch means human in German, but it can also be a way of saying man! or oh man!. It’s often used to show dissatisfaction with someone or something. Or, in that moment where you’re two streets away from your house and you realise you left your mobile phone at home.

If you’ve got a friend who does something you’re not particularly fond of you can say, “Mensch!” followed by their name to express your dissatisfaction. “Mensch, Marie!” can be a good way of getting your point across.

And if you’re two streets from home and realise you’ve forgotten your mobile phone, you can exclaim “Mensch!” before turning around and going back.
