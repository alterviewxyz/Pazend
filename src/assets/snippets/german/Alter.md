### Alter!
It can used to express surprise, informally greet someone or as an interjection.

It’s a shortened version of the term, “Alter Schwede” which translates to old Swedish man in English. I’m not sure what old Swedish men did to deserve this term, but you can hear it all over Germany.

You might hear Germans using it as a way to say mate or man to greet you, in a sentence like “Alter, was geht ab?”, which is man, what’s going on?.

You can also use it to express surprise or disbelief in something. For example one of my friends at Rugby asked me my age, and I told him I was 25. He laughed and said, “Alter! Nein, wirklich, wie alt bist du?”, or Man! No, really, how old are you?, which did nothing for my ego as he thought I was 32.

You can use it at the start of a sentence to express disbelief, or to add effect to what you’re saying:

```
“Alter! Ist das euer Auto?” – Man! Is that your car?
“Alter Schwede! Was hast du gemacht?” – My God! What did you do?
“Alter! Mach doch!” – Man! Get on with it.
```
