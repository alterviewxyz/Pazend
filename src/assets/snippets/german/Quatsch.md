### Quatsch

Quatsch is a fun word to say which comes with a few different meanings.

One of the most common ones is a light-hearted way of saying, Don’t be silly!. For example, “Ich wollte mich bei dir Bedanken, für das Geschenk” (I wanted to thank you for the present) could be met with “Quatsch! Ich wollte dir was schenken” (Don’t be silly! I wanted to give you a present).

Quatch can also be used when you think someone is saying something untruthful. “Was für Quatsch redest du?” (What are you talking about!?).

You can say it to release some frustration. Saying “Quatsch!” out loud when something bad happens is the same as shouting, Bollocks! in English.

Finally, you can turn it into the verb Quatschen to say that you’re just chatting away with someone. “Ich bin jetzt bei Ela. Wir quatchen nur. Ich komme bald nach Hause”, (I’m with Ela right now. We’re just chatting. I’ll come home soon.)
