### Sau-
Sau is a versatile prefix you can add to lots of adjectives to emphasise how extreme something is. A Sau is a female pig, but for some reason it’s also used as a slang.

The first time I heard this word it was the middle of summer at a wine festival in western Germany. It was boiling hot and the people around me would say that it was, “Sauwarm” which means it’s absolutely sweltering.

You can combine some basic vocabulary, and words you’ve learned on this list, to create some native sounding variations:

- saulekker – Incredibly tasty
- Saugeil – Insanely cool
- Sauteuer – Really expensive
