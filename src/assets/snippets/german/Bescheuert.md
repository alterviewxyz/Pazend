### Bescheuert
Bescheuert roughly translates to dumb or stupid in English. But it also comes with the connotation that someone is one sandwich short of a picnic, or their head is, well… up their arsch.

It’s not uncommon to hear Germans referring to particular politicians as “Total bescheuert!” when they disagree with their opinions or policy changes.
