### Geil
Geil is a word used to describe anything you feel is cool, tasty or an interesting surprise. But it’s also an odd word because “geil” technically means, well…horny.

But Germans don’t think of it in that context when they use it. Kind of how people in English might use sick to describe something good, without thinking the word really means unwell or vomiting.

You’ll often hear geil in sentences like:

- “Man, das Essen war so geil!”- Man, that food was amazing!
- “Was hat sie gemacht? Geil!” – What did she do? Brilliant!
- “Ich habe ein geiles Restaurant gefunden” – I found a really cool restaurant
