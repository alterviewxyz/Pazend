### Hammer
Hammer is the tool you use to bang nails into wood. It’s the same word in German as in English. But the Germans also use it to describe that something is cool or outstanding.

It can be used simply as, “Hammer!” to respond to something cool you’ve heard or seen. But you can also expand a little bit.

Let’s say you’ve spent the afternoon at a soccer game and someone asked you if you saw the match-winning goal. You could say, “Alter, es war der Hammer!”, wich means Man, it was a doozy!

You can use that sentence on its own to describe lots of things you’ve seen or done.
