### Verarschen
Verarschen is a great word to express when someone is messing you around, pulling your leg or taking the piss.

This can be used in a light-hearted way like, “Ich verarsche dich nur” can be said like I’m just joking around with you. Or if you were to say, “Verarschen kann ich mich selber!” you’d be sarcastically saying, My eye!.

Or if you want to take a more serious standpoint you could say, “Willst du mich verarschen?” (Are you trying to take the piss?), when you feel that someone is doing something to wrong you.
