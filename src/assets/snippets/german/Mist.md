###  Mist!
Mist is used in the same way as crap or bugger might be used in English. It’s relatively inoffensive and can be used to express mild negative emotions. You know, when something isn’t enough to ruin your day, but you wish it hadn’t happened.

You can slot “Mist!” or “Ach, mist!” in wherever you would say crap or oh crap in your normal everyday conversations.
