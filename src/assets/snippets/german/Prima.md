### Prima!
Prima is a way of saying something or someone is great. When I hear Prima, it always sounds happy, like an early 19th century English gentleman saying, “Tip top ol’ chap”

Here are some examples of prima in action:

- “Das ist prima” – That’s excellent
- “Er ist ein prima Kerl!” – He’s a top bloke
- s“Sie macht das prima” – She does that so well
